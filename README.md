# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-From-Scratch

This repository gathers the essential Machine Learning algorithms coded from scratch using only: 
  - **Numpy**: for algebraic, and statistical operations
  - **Sklearn**: for generating testing data

## Getting Started:
  - Start by setting up a python **virtual environment** by running: 
```bash
   python -m virtual_env_name /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
  - Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
   .\virtual_env_name\Scripts\activate
```
  - Install the required libraries:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  - All the folders contain at least two files:
      - **model_name.py**: contains the class that implements a specific ML model or technique.
      - **main.py**: contains the testing script, it usually has an accuracy check or a plotting of the result.
    To test the implementation, you can drag and drop the main file to the main directory \

    <br />
    then, you can run:
```bash
   python main.py
```

### Resources:
  - The tutorial that engaged me in creating this repository is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLOyrWV8gmA), it helps to understand the coding phase of the algorithms, and it contains pretty usefull testing scripts that I have used.
  - Although the previous tutorial was mostly enriching, in the theoretical part, I have taken advantage of insightful blogs written in [Towards DataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/), [Ask Python](https://www.askpython.com/), and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
    I have included all the blogs that I have read to write the code implementation in its corresponding file.
  - For people who like to visualize things, I recommend the following youtube channels: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest), [Visually Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@VisuallyExplained), and [Intuitive Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@IntuitiveMachineLearning).

***Happy Learning!***
